# Final-Project


Final Project:


 A text-based dungeon adventure walk-through game. 
 
 
Project file structure:


 To run program, Control package --> DungeonInterface.java
 
 Control package houses DungeonInterface.java, to run main program and JUnit Test files
 ControlTests package houses all of the initial tests during the creation process
 
 Character package houses all character files for Decorator Pattern
 DungeonController package houses all dungeon and room files for Controller Pattern
 DungeonState package houses all files associated to the player character current state for the State Pattern
 Monster package houses all monster files for Factory Pattern
 
 Gear package houses all gear files associated to the Character build


Design Patterns:


 x Characters - decorator pattern
 
 x Monsters - factory pattern
 
 x Dungeon/Rooms - controller pattern
 
 x Player character status - state pattern
 
 
JUnit Tests:


 x Character Decorator Pattern JUnit Test
    To run JUnit Test, Control package --> CharacterJUnitTest.java
 
 x Monster Factory Pattern JUnit Test
    To run JUnit Test, Control package --> MonsterJUnitTest.java


Final Project Objectives:


 x Use 4 design patterns contained within the design patterns book. (50%)

 x Program a fully working application in Java to highlight the design patterns you learned (no compile/not running is an automatic fail)

 x Implement some unit tests. Doesn't have to be complete coverage, minimum test 2 design patterns (25%)

x write up reflecting the challenges and difficulties you faced and how you learned from them (25%)
